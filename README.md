### What is Cloudogu?
Cloudogu is an open platform, which lets you choose how and where your team creates great software. Each service or tool is delivered as a [Dōgu](https://translate.google.com/?text=D%26%23x014d%3Bgu#ja/en/%E9%81%93%E5%85%B7), a Docker container, that can be easily integrated in your environment just by pulling it from our registry. We have a growing number of ready-to-use Dōgus, e.g. SCM-Manager, Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, Redmine and many more. Every Dōgu can be tailored to your specific needs. You can even bring along your own Dōgus! Take advantage of a central authentication service, a dynamic navigation, that lets you easily switch between the web UIs and a smart configuration magic, which automatically detects and responds to dependencies between Dōgus. Cloudogu is open source and it runs either on-premise or in the cloud. Cloudogu is developed by Cloudogu GmbH under [MIT License](https://cloudogu.com/license.html) and it runs either on-premise or in the cloud.
