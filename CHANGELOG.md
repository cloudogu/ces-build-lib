## [Unreleased]

### Changed - 2024-09-26

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/cloudogu/ces-build-lib/releases/tag/2.3.0) - 2024-09-11

This is useful if default components like the blueprint-operator have to be disabled.

## [1.65.1](https://github.com/cloudogu/ces-build-lib/releases/tag/1.65.1) - 2023-08-17

- `findVulnerabilitiesWithTrivy` schema bug fix
  - The trivy output scheme is now interpreted correctly
  - Added `additionalFlags` as parameter e.g. '--ingore-unfixed' can be used now

## [1.65.0](https://github.com/cloudogu/ces-build-lib/releases/tag/1.65.0) - 2023-06-06

### Changed
- `findVulnerabilitiesWithTrivy` #107
  - Switch from using `allowlist` param to built-in `.trivyignore` file. Advantage: More declarative.  
    Fewer things in Jenkinsfile. Local trivy scans pick up allowlist as well.
  - Updated Trivy default to 0.41.0 from 0.15.0.
    - Trivy 0.20.0 introduced a JSON schema (see [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/discussions/1050))
    - `findVulnerabilitiesWithTrivy` code can now only parse the new one
    - `findVulnerabilitiesWithTrivy` returns the new schema 
  - These are somewhat breaking changes, which will likely not affect anyone. So we dared to make them. Make sure to
    - not use `allowlist`, if so migrate to `.trivyignore`
    - not pin the `trivyVersion`, or update to trivy >= `0.20.0`
    - if you parsed the result of `findVulnerabilitiesWithTrivy` make sure to migrate to new schema, 
      e.g. `VulnerabilityID` moved to `.Results[].Vulnerabilities[].VulnerabilityID`
